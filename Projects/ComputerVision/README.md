### Alhambra II Apio projects

-vga_test_100mhz
  Display a test card on a 640x480 VGA with Alhambra II using 100MHz PLL generated clock
  
-ov7670_rgb444_80x60
  Display 80x60 video on a VGA from the ov7670 camera.
  Preliminary version, adjustments required

### ov7670_xilinx: 
Interfacing the OV7670 camera with a Xilinx Nexys4 FPGA and displaying the video through VGA. Next step is to do it with an Alhambra II FPGA board. There are 2 versions:
  + VHDL
  + Verilog
